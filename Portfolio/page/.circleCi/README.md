## DEPLOYING FROM CIRCLECI PIPELINE TO S3 BUCKET
Here we will be updating our portfolio to github and connect circleci pipeling to deploy to S3 bucket 

### Prerequisite
1. Updating S3 bucket to be hosting our website from  AWS CloudFront
--- It when ever we update our file to S3 bucket, we will alwasy need to expose the file to public view which will defeated our automation.
--- In order to avoid such, we will be using AWS CloudFront host to Edge Location 

### ⚙️ Steps 1 - Hosting to CloudFront (Edge Location)
- Visit AWS and search for CloudFront

- Get your CloudFront Url

### ⚙️ Steps 2 - Disable s3_bucket access 
Here we only want access to s3 bucket through cloundfront (CDN)
1. Visit your S3 bucket 
2. Go to the permission tab and proceed
